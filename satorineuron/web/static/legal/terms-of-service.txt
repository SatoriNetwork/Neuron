TERMS OF SERVICE (ToS)

1. INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Satori Neuron software ("Software"). These Terms of Service ("ToS") govern your use of the Software, which is provided by The Satori Association ("we", "us", "our"). By using the Software, you agree to be bound by these ToS.

The purpose of these ToS is to outline the rules and guidelines for using the Software and to ensure that all users understand their rights and responsibilities. The Software subscribes to real-world data streams, makes predictions about those data streams, and shares those predictions with other Satori neurons, forming a future-predicting network.

2. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you agree to comply with and be bound by these ToS. If you do not agree to these ToS, you must not use the Software.

3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

The Software provides the following services:

Subscribing to real-world data streams.
Making predictions about the future of those data streams.
Sharing predictions with other Satori neurons.

4. USER RESPONSIBILITIES

Users agree to:

Use the Software in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
Not use the Software for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.
Not interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Software or the data contained therein.
Keep any generated public keys and addresses secure and confidential.

5. COMMUNICATION CONSENT

By providing your contact information, you consent to The Satori Association contacting you via email, mobile SMS, or voice calls for the purposes of account verification, providing updates, and ensuring the security of your account. This communication is necessary to maintain the integrity of the services provided by the Website and to assist in any verification or security processes required.

6. PROHIBITED USES

Users must not:

Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.
Distribute copies of the Software to others.
Use the Software in any way that disrupts or abuses the network, including overloading servers, sending spam, or engaging in malicious activities.
Share any data as an oracle that is not intended for public consumption.

7. SOFTWARE IDENTIFICATION

The Software does not require traditional user account registration (such as choosing a username or providing an email address). Instead, upon its first startup, the Software generates a unique private-public key pair, which serves as its permanent identity.

Private Key: The Software keeps its private key secure and private, stored locally on the user's device.
Public Key: The Software shares its public key with anyone who requests it during its normal operations on the Satori Network.
This unique identification method allows the Software to verify its identity and interact securely with other nodes on the network and with Satori servers, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of its operations.

8. TERMINATION

We may terminate or suspend your access to the Software immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including if you breach these ToS. Upon termination, your right to use the Software will cease immediately.

9. MODIFICATIONS TO THE SERVICE AND TERMS

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Software at any time, with or without notice. We may also modify these ToS from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new ToS on our website or within the Software. Your continued use of the Software after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new ToS.

10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

12. GOVERNING LAW

These ToS shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Switzerland.

13. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Any disputes arising under or in connection with these ToS shall first be attempted to be resolved through mediation.

The costs of mediation shall be shared equally between the parties.
