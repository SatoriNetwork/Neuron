DONE remove row number cache design from disk, add in regular old cache design.
DONE move scheduler up to the engine level, cycle through all datasets.
DONE make sure we clear out any bad data at all times.
DONE move the cache out of the topic, and up to the startDag singleton, then make everything pull from the same cache, such DONE as the relay stuff, rendezvous stuff, and engine, anything that uses the Disk object currently.

DONE fix installer - must make sure to pull the latest version explicitly
DONE fix open browser - before blocking
DONE loop until docker pulls correctly
DONE fix installer - windows doesn't recognize it as safe - sign it.
FINE fix installer - on one computer windows defender flagged it as a "bearfoos" virus, so we have to figure that out. - doesn't happen on more up to date windows machines
DONE fix pause functionality - it's reversed, paused by default I think?
DONE I noticed histories aren't downloading automatically. explore...
DONE fix issue where we can miss some of the raw data stream and we'd never know, except we would because when we ask and it doesn't match our hash we know it's no goood. so we have to ask for the history backwards until we find the missing data. the best solution is to broadcast the hash in the pubsub. then if it looks like the hash is invalid, we know that we missed something. at that point what should we do? when it looks like our dataset is missing something we should? ask for the middle hash, then see if it matches, so on and so forth until we identify the missing one? not sure.
DONE when we broadcast a prediction we need to include time and observationHash too
DONE not saving observations
DONE assign a stream a random time... key it off the name... make the rendezvous connection happen at that time every day
DONE remove ping
DONE still have a connection annoyance,with moontree and checkin and maybe pubsub? but it connects eventually on startup.
DONE rendezvous - early worker timeout
DONE ping solution
DONE add something that fixes data - like when we send a check that verifies the hashes before we send
DONE fix logging - remove debugs 
DONE fix logging - add add info about all coming and going
DONE start over if we've never established the root
DONE something broke in responding to requests?
DONE follow newData: save, trigger prediction, save that prediction, publish
DONE we should show predictions on the dashboard

DONE central - add mac installer to webiste
DONE neuron - respect offset: now that we are doing the cadence by the proper utc time, we can use the offset as intended.
DONE neuron - fix offset issues: if you add a data stream with an offset and save it, it works fine. But when you enter its edit mode and try to remove or change the offset, the system freezes. You have to refresh the page, but the offset remains unchanged.
DONE neuron - debug - large number of streams takes a long time to open cache - why? - beucase it's rehashing them? or no? 50 + streams takes 10-30 minutes

DONE neuron - config entry to include vault address, vault pubkey, and signature
DONE neuron - signature involves (decrypted) address

DONE atomic swaps:
DONE neuron - if they have no currency, generate a transaction without currency input but using 1 SATORI as the sending fee: generate an output without an address, send to server.
DONE central - take transaction and supply sufficient RVN fee in inputs, and add output with own address and 1 SATORI.

central - fix - publications not working
neuron - fix - subscriptions not being turned into anything...
central - fix - call to database to get predictions is broken
neuron - fix - voting page is broken
neuron - fix - checkin - something wrong with subscriptions and publications
neuron - isolate transactions to it's own page/call
neuron - isolate stream votes to it's own page/call

neuron - vault - require password twice on first setup
neuron - fix self.disk issues, sometimes we don't have stream data we should...?

central - either move sanction out it it's own table, rebuilding streams or update in bulk with a temporary table (probably ideal)

central - add manifest queries
central - add sanction queries
central - test everything

neuron - just automatically give neurons sanctioned datastreams to work on.
neuron - allow users to pause individually.

neuron - hide/grey inactive streams allow users to cycle to new ones.

central - test the average cadence query
central - make it a soft delete - one reason we need it is streams can be published by others
central - modify queries to respect soft delete.
central - derived cadence as well from history table
central - consider turning observation table into a view on history...
central - should we purge history more than 60 days old

vault - allow user to change vault password
vault - allow for automatic send of tokens to their vault
vault - allow for voting with vaulted coins and wallet coins
vault - creation process with saving words
vault - show words on page as well as private key
wallet - show words on page as well as private key

central - make a history table and test the history table
central - make sure server is saving history of observations
central - purge history more than 8 days old

neuron - point everything at evrmore wallet instead of ravencoin wallet and test
all - convert rvn wallet to evr wallet
all - all test evr manually since electrum servers are newer versions for evr
central - update website (images)
central - update website (copy)
central - update website (yellowpaper)

central - if a neuron is subscribed to an unsanctioned stream does that neuron get reassigned a sanctioned datastream?
central - if a neuron is subscribed to an unsanctioned stream does the user know about it?

central - we will need an admin dashboard to track the activity of the network

neuron - make the wallet value on dashboard and wallet pages and vault update more realtime
neuron - doesn't have to be subscriptions to the electrumx, although that would be ideal,
neuron - could just be calling get just for the balance right after broadcasting, and right after distributions are scheduled to go out daily.

-- Launch --

-- Nice --

central - setup electrumx server for evr

neuron - settings:
neuron - change 'configuration' to settings, remove whats there, include options like, autorequest sanctioned datastreams
central - if a neuron is subscribed to an unsanctioned stream does the user know about it, and have the ability to switch to a sanctioned one? can that be a setting?

all - include different languages in neuron and on website, etc.

neuron - make values get pushed to front end UI for relay streams in realtime

Wallet Encryption:
    neuron - we really should at least give the option to encrypt the wallet yaml
    neuron - so on the wallet page add a card for encryption
    neuron - and ask for their password when showing the secret
    neuron - the only problem is in order to sign anything to verify your identity you need to use the private key... so the user would have to provide their password everytime satori starts... This is a problem for later... when they can authorize from their phone...


neuron - allow neurons to predict any stream by choice (include their own), but make them ineligible for reward for those streams
"""
ah, I see.

Well, you know what we probably should do that huh? We don't currently allow a neuron to predict its own streams because we wanted to avoid the problem of unfair advantage, so I think the right solution is actually to allow a neuron to predict its own streams but it won't be eligible for prediction reward on those particular streams, because since it's the one that's also generating them it could know them before it releases them to everyone else.

So that's a change I'm going to have to make.
"""
neuron - add the ability to manually trigger update, or make it instant and automatic.
