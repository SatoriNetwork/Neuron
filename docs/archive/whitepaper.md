Satori 
a network for the future

What is Satori? 
1. a blockchain is a protocol - a protocol is how to talk about something
2. Satori has carved out a space to communicate about time. Satori is a protocol (an efficient way) to talk about predictions of the future

What are the main components of Satori?
3. it has 3 main concepts:
  1. a datastream - the main unit of organization. Datastreams are predicted. descrete packets of information about something like a stock feed or weather data. usually it doesn't have a definite end. the only things that need be published are changes. it's should come with a recognizable time description of the change. ideally there's a place to get the entire history of it. it must have a unique id. It is it's own oracle.
  2. a predictor - the predictor predicts datastreams one step out into the future. they say, "the next peice of information that comes from this datastream will be: x" They don't even tell you when it wil happen. they just predict the next thing. This works because you can have multiple datastreams describing the same thing at different time intervals: the high temperature for tomorrow, the high for the coming 7 days, etc.
  3. the pubsub map - this is a map of all publishers and subscribers available to the network. This shared map, brought to you by blockchain consensus, helps each predictor (subscriber) in the network know what datafeeds might be most helpful to them in predicting whatever datastream they're trying to predict.

Public vs Private:
4. A predictor "mines" the datastreams that are posted to the network. Prediction is a public good and each computer that joins the network will automatically be assigned something to predict, and receives automatic payments, everything is automated. Unless you don't want it to be, then you can compete in the marketplace.
5. the market way to use Satori is to compete for bounties. People will post datastreams they want predicted, even privately predicted. any predictor can compete, and the best predictions win. What will typically happen is that an initial competition will take place where a few predictors emerge as pretty predictive most of the time. The consumer, who paid the rewards for the competition will end the competition and the competitors continue to predict the datastream at low public rates or can charge a small fee for subscription to their feed, which the original consumer may pay for as an ongoing prediction of their datafeed.

to sum up:
1. Anyone can post a datastream.
2. Anyone can download the Satori Node software and automatically start mining datastreams, generating predictions, and getting paid for their work on the network. Its fully automatic.
3. Ultimately, Satori is just a blockchain protocol so those that want to use the protocol in a manual way, those that want to compete in a market environment for more rewards, are encouraged to do so.
4. Lastly, the chain itself can be mined or queried by the public for free, with Satori in place, everyone can know the future of anything.
