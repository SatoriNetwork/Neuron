remote: EHiB6LJvhkY8dbkXAJjMRG6jWdgnvqvZnS
delegate: EJwQdjEXzc2tRQW6mLBgifjQLBqrMwF765

the remote is v2.08 so it should work since it said saved on the remote side

the remote side seems to be working now which is weird. just tried on another v2.06 and it says saved
[6:23 PM]
well, it seems isolated to just that delegate. got 2 others to work fine
